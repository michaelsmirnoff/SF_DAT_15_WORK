I plan to investigate the following hypothesis:

The expanding income inequality in the United States is pushing wealth to a number of major metro areas in the U.S., e.g., San Francisco, NYC, DC, Houston.  With no end in sight to income inequality expansion, can I predict the rate of real estate price increases in line with inequality expansion?

Boiled into a question: Can I predict the rate of real estate price increases in "creative class" cities by looking at real estate trends and income inequality trends?
