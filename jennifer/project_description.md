### Project Description 

*What is the question you hope to answer?*
What factors best predict the rate of Facebook shares for any particular Facebook post on DoS English-language Facebook pages? Particularly, does the topic or theme of the post impact the number of Facebook shares?

*What data are you planning to use to answer that question?*
In the Office of Analytics, we have access to Insights data for a number of DoS Facebook properties that can give us impressions, likes, comments and share metrics for each Facebook post. We also have content tagged by theme and topic that these Facebook pages often post.  We can import these tags, and when third party content has been posted, I can hand code this data according to the tagging regimen already in existence.

*What do you know about the data so far?*
I've worked with similar sets of data before and have done some coding by hand as described above. I will want to get a share rate - number of shares over impressions - but that just involves creating a new column and dividing one column by another.  I'll also have to insert a new column, import tags from our web-based ShareAmerica platform, and then for third-party content, I'll have to do some hand coding as described above.

*Why did you chose this topic?*
I wanted to work with Facebook data because I often work with Twitter data, and have only recently been asked to work with Facebook data.  I also wanted to do something useful to my Bureau - so developing some insights that could help our content team create content that gets more shares on DoS Facebook properties fits that purpose.
