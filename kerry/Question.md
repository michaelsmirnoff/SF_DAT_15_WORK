What is the question you hope to answer? What data are you planning to use to answer that question? What do you know about the data so far? Why did you choose this topic?


**Project Question:**

The All-NBA team has been annual awarded bestowed to the best players in the league at the end of every season. It is particularly based on votes conducted by sportswriter and broadcasters across North America.  There are three-five man teams: First, Second, and Third. 

Given that avaliable basketball data, can we predict which players will be voted into each team by the end of the 2014-15 season? 

I found the following dataset off reddit. It contains data for players from 1953 - 2014 scraped off Basketball-Reference.com. 

[Basketball data](https://github.com/abresler/abresler.github.io/tree/master/data/NBA/player_data/all_player_per_game)

It contains the following stats:

Name,Position,Age,Games_Played,Minutes_Played,Field_Goal_Per, Three_Point_Per,Two_Point_Per,Effective_Field_Goal_Per, Free_Throw_Per, Offensive_Rebounds,Defensive_Rebounds,Total_Rebounds, Assist,Steals,Blocks,Turnovers

I think have at each playerâ€™s team respective team Win-Loss Record to the dataset

I would be interested how additional metrics effect the prediction such as: WinShare,
Player Efficiency Rating, points created, points produced, etc. Descriptions of more can be found here.

I will probably need help scraping more data but found this github page
[Python NBA Web Scraper](https://github.com/abresler/NBA-Data-Stuff)

Do you think it would be advantageous to collect all these stats for each player per game or would that be unncessary?
 
I am interested in this because of always had an interest in starting a basketball blog, or at least doing advanced analytics on basketball data sets.
