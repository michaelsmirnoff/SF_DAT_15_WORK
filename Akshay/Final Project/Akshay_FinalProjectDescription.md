<h1> Akshay's Final Project Description</h1>
<h2> Terrorism and its Effect on Financial Markets</h2>
</head>

<body>
<p> Because terrorist attacks tend to target strategic assets such as oil fields, financial insitutions, and military installations, terrorism has complex reprecussions on financial markets. How do particular industries react to attacks? My paper will focus on the behavior of stocks after successful terrorist attacks and determine exactly how resilient specific markets are to terrorism. Specifially, how does terrorism affect market capitalization immediately following the attack and in the long term? Is there a similiarty in effect on markets regardless of type of attack, or do the specificites of the plot effect the behavior of financial markets? </p>

<br></br>
<p> To answer these questions, I will use Bloomberg API data as well as data from the <a href="http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/Global"> UMD Global Terrorism Database</a> and <a href="http://www.rand.org/nsrd/projects/terrorism-incidents/download.html"> RAND Corporation Data on Worldwide Terrorism Incidents</a> </p>
