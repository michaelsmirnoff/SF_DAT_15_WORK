**Comments on Deron’s Project from Lambert**

*I’ve read through the project description, and I’m confused about what the response variable is – discount rate, right?  What does that mean – the amount of the discount used?  As in which type of discount actually results in a completed ride, perhaps?  I’m not sure what you’re aiming to predict.

*Ok, I couldn’t run the code at first b/c the code to actually pull in the csv file in the beginning wasn’t there – but easy fix! Saved the csv file to the desktop and read it into python, then ran the code.  I’m not really the person to look to for coding help – but I did see error language about “the least populated class in y has only 1 member, which is too few” for the with K=9 the KNN function – so you might want to ask one of the instructors about that.

*My main issue is just that I don’t understand the response value and what it can tell you about the discounts and the customers who use them – if you could spell that out a little better for someone who doesn’t know much about this field/type of data, that would be really useful.

*I think you did a good job of reorienting your project once you realized your first idea wasn’t going to work as well.  And I really like the idea of using data from your company to do something that will offer value to your employer.
