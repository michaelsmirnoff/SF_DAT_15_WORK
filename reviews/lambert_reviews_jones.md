#Lambert Reviews Kerry’s Rough Draft#

* Interesting project. Now, I don’t have a lot of specific domain knowledge about basketball, but you talk about three different all-star teams - the All NBA team, the Rookie team, and the All Defensive team - but then you talk about a ranking system whereby voters vote on a player by giving them a 5, 3, or 1 based on whether they think a player should be on the first team, second team, or third team.  Are the All NBA, Rookie, and Defensive teams ranked somehow? Or are you talking about three five-man All NBA teams in your project? (I think it’s the later based on going through the data, right?)

* Kudos on the data scraping!  I thought that was cool when we learned it in class, but I have yet to apply it.

* When I ran the code, I got errors when the code attempted to fit the logistic regression, so you might want to check on that.  But I am the last person in a position to give coding advice, so realize that I might have done something wrong.

* It occurs to me that other data you might try is including something to account for the popularity of the players - maybe mentions in media or mentions on Twitter? I know being an avid football fan that MVPs and All Pro selections often go to players that are fan favorites or media favorites - not necessarily the best at their position (case in point - Aaron Rodgers!).
