Strengths
Use of key words/tags to identify themes and correlate with shares
Use of Map to set theme values
Use of linear regression to identify significant relationships
Use of z-scores to evaluate shares per users reached

Proposed Improvements
Build model with original shares per user reached and compare models
Revisit AUC as stated below

Questions
What was the purpose for splitting "Themes"? 

Suggestions
Further define the performance metric from the point of engagement if possible(Share? Share + Reply Mention? Share + Comment? etc.)
Predict effective, high sharing posts with classifier based on features with greatest value to the model
