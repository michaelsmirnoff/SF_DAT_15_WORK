### Project Review

First, I think your project topic is really interesting and a lot of people in the class will be eager to hear about your results-- it impacts all of our lives a lot, unfortunately.

I mostly just have questions, but hopefully they might help you steer your thinking if you haven't already thought about it:

1. How far back does the data exist for your data sets? I think it'd be fascinating if the data went back far (i.e. 100 years), but would be surprising if it did. I might look for historical data across European cities too if that helps expand your set/timeframe.

2. There are probably benefits of doing both linear/reg and clustering, and I would do both if you have time. The modeling might be more fun to do in clustering (seeing the layers of home prices/types by city), but linear is going to give you the straightforward projections that people will be interested in.

3. Another data set that could be interesting to include if you don't mind adding on more work is here: http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/how-your-citys-public-transit-stacks-up/. It includes data ranking cities by public transportation factors, which might add some predictive power into your models.
