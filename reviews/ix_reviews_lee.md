### Project Review

This is cool. I like the idea of going beyond just using stock data and using visuals, though I didn't fully understand the application how you'd use this in the real world (I'm just ignorant). For the final presentation, I think people are going to love this if you're able to make the connection from what you're building to the practical applications of it (even if its just potential applications, obviously), i.e. why visualizations are better/different than just using the raw data.

You've made a lot of progress, you've commented your code really well, and you seem to have a good idea of your next steps. A couple of things I might consider:

* Regarding the memory issue you discussed, I'd try the MapReduce/multi-processing topics we discussed in the last class.
* I like your idea of going away from binary towards multiple classifiers. You can train using log/rf/nb like you said, and then you could also do ensembling with all of them.
* For your presentation, I'd include example visualizations to help people comprehend the metrics you are using.

Good luck finishing up!
