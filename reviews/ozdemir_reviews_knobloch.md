#### Preliminary thoughts
We have been working a while on your data acqusition and cleaning and I think you are finally ready for the next step!

####Analysis
I think you have a good idea of where you wnt to go with your analysis. You have the right idea of keeping in mind the many types of predictions (regression vs. classification) you have at your disposal.

####Suggestions
1. I might try to do a decision tree for your classification and see if you get better predictions out of that.
2. You could also to an LDA to find "topics" of patents like technology, medical, etc and see if you could use that as a predictor
3. To make the prediction easier, you could reduce the number of categories to have a bucket for "venture", "series a", "series b", "series c", "series d" and "other"
4. Will you include companies with patents who did not get funding?

As always, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
