#### Preliminary thoughts
I put some of my thoughts on the github pull requests page so please let me know if you have any questions based on that as well.

####Predictors
What are your predictors going to be to predict whether or not a promo code will be used? And where are you getting it from?

I hope my comment on bucketing the promo code discount was clear, it is a common way of turning a regression problem into a classification problem for ease.

Project pivoting can be tough so I want to make sure you know that you can always feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
