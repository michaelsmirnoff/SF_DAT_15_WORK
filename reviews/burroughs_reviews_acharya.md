Hey Ganesh.  Good job.  I see you've come a long way in figuring out how to extract features from this complex dataset!

* By convention, people usually ```import``` all of the external libraries all at once at the top of the code file.  It's not a big deal, but I just wanted to note it.
* Good job finding and using ```glob.glob('../data/drivers/*/*')```.  I've never seen this before, but I'll be keeping it in mind for the future!
* I think your comments are good for a next step on this project.  Try to determine how to extract more features from this dataset.  This is a good dataset to practice with, because the key here is getting the features rather than picking a better model.
* On that note, once you have more features, you may want to try different models to see if you get any "easy" improvements from the better model.
