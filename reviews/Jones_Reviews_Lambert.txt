Kerry Jones commnets:
1) Clear and concise goal of project 
2) Like how you commented and broke down code step by step
3) Data dictionary would be good to help bette understand the variables. Maybe also consider shortening the column names
4) Random Forest/Decision Tree would be good to try and you may also want to compute feature importance. 
5) Confused about what lambda does
6) Line 63:
feature_cols = ['A', 'B', 'C'] #where did these column names come from?
