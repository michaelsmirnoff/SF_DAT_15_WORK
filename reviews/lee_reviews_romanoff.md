## Peer Review
### Alex Lee for Stephen Romanoff

#### Strengths

This is a very practical topic, and I think that you can probably find some non-trivial results looking across some of the varied datasets noted in your draft paper.  I find the idea of combining a more qualitative, clustering-type problem (based on demographic or otherwise-defined classes) and a harder financial regression problem to be particularly interesting.

#### Comments on areas for potential improvement

Hard to say here without seeing some code -- based on the gist of the paper outline and the skeleton slides, I think that the main area I'd like to see fleshed out would be the modeling approach.  You allude to both regression and classification in the slides, and I think that both could definitely figure in to a model of housing prices, but I don't see a concrete methodology outlined yet.

#### Questions

- Are you planning to incorporate analysis of "classes" of residents into the analysis of housing prices?  Or are you taking it as a given that the "creative class" is moving to urban centers in the US?
- Are you more concerned with predicted prices (regression), or with the predicted trend of prices in the future (potentially clustering)?  I can certainly see arguments for both being important to a prospective home buyer.

N/A

#### Suggestions for next steps

I think a logical next step might be to work up a skeleton of the logic for the model itself (just in text/notes form) -- it's easier to move things around in rough form like that before writing code and trying to change that around later.  I think there are a number of interesting directions this analysis could go given the data referenced and the ideas outlined in your notes thus far, so I leave those related modeling decisions to you, but I think it would be a helpful thing to build out.
