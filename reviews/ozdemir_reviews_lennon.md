#### Preliminary thoughts
I think this is a very interesting idea. Save us from the wrath of the Sun!

####Analysis
I think your predictors are very clear and I think you have a very good idea as to where you are going. As far as the models you have chosen, having an AUC of .606 is not necessarily terrible, but also keep in mind differences between accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. What are they for your project and is one of them more important than the others?


####Suggestions
1. I might try to do a decision tree for your classification and see if you get better predictions out of that.
2. This relates to what we discussed in class, but were you able to find out a bit more about the classes of sunflares and if there was more to them than just a name? I ask because what might be cool if you try to cluster them with K-Means and see if they cluster naturally by class.


As always, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
