## Lennon reviews Vincello

* Nice use of Quandl for your raw data.
* You chose to use logistic regression and random forests, why did you choose these two models?
* I like how you define function in the code.  Especially the ROC-AUC plot and kill nulls functions.
* It would be nice to see more comments in the code.  Why do you use the Pandas shift feature?
* You indexed your data frame on date, great idea.  This is a useful trick and helps joining data frames.
* What were your reasons for adding the feature that multiplies volume by the change in closing prices?
* Why does the roc auc score improve as the prediction distance increases?
* There is a spike in oil around 2009 that looks like a real feature and not noise.  It would be interesting to hear what caused this.  Why is this feature not present in the Bollinger Band calculation?
