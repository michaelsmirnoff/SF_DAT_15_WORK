###Romanoff reviews Ix

Frank, I think you've got a great start on this Kaggle competition and think it's really cool that your are tackling this for your project.

####Project Strengths

Clear and concise understanding of what you are trying to solve and a good idea of how.

Good initial model.

####Questions 
I think you have a good set of potential predictors, but I'm a little unclear how they come together to identify patterns for specific drivers.  

####Comments on code
Not all the code worked for me.  Specifically, I got an error when I tried to run line 39: "Shape of passed values is (0, 0), indices imply (1, 0)"

I did a little stackoverflow research and i still couldn't get it to run.  That said, I  follow what you are trying to do with your code and think you have a good approach.

####Possible Next Steps
I think developing more models, as you already plan to, will really help with the pattern challenge.
