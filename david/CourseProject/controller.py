loans in MSA by tract
owner occupied
1-4 family homes
conventional mortgages
home purchase loans
first lien loans

Analysis:
application count by tract
	minority/non-minority
origination count by tract
	minority/non-minority

compare % of applications originated by tract
	minority/non-minority
compare origination percent (chance?) to minority population percent
	are originations different for minority/non-minority status?
compare minority application % to minority population percent
	are mortgage applications the same by minority status?
use a logit model to predict origination or denial using
	income, location, loan amount race
		determine if minority status was significant in origination decision
use linear regression to check on pricing by minority/non-minority status

minority status percentage by applications (and originations? are these recorded separately?)
