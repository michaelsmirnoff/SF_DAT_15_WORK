#Data Science 4: Draft Proposal#

##Question##
Do clinical trial attributes influence if a particular drug is deemed more innovative during FDA review? More specifically, can innovation category classification rules be determined for differences in clinical trial attributes among drug and biologic products?

##Data##
I propose to obtain the innovation category data from a published seminal paper on drug innovation (Lanthier, et all 2013) and the clinical trials data from ClinicalTrials.gov. I hope to use the active ingredient as a key between the two databases.
The Lanthier data is in .pdf form and has approximately 300+ records while the full ClinicalTrials.gov data contains 181,882 records and can be downloaded in XML.

##Why##
Predicting and determining why a particular drug or biologic is innovative poses a number of questions that I hope to shed light on.
