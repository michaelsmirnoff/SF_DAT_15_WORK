#INFERRING INNOVATIVE DRUGS FROM ADVERSE EVENT DATA#

##Question##
Can adverse event (AE) data predict whether a particular drug was deemed more innovative during U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review? More specifically, 
can innovation category classification rules be determined for differences in AE attributes among drug and biologic products?

##Data##
I propose to obtain the innovation category data from a published seminal paper on drug innovation (Lanthier, et all 2013) and the AE data from the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). 
I hope to use the brand name as a key between the two databases.The Lanthier data is in .pdf form and has approximately 300+ records 
while the full FAERS data contains roughly +5 million records and can be downloaded in ASCII or SGML.

##Why##
Predicting and determining why a particular drug or biologic is innovative poses a number of questions that I hope to shed light on.

#PROGRESS#

##Objective##
My objective is to determine whether any of the AE columns can be used as regressors to predict a drugs classification as either "Addtion to Class" or "Advanced in Class".
There are three primary classes first determined by the Lanthier et al data: 

+ "First in Class" - the first drug approved with its specific therapuetic mechanism;
+ "Advanced in Class" - thought to desmonstrate improved therapuetic or safety benefit over existing drugs and demonstrated if a drug
achieved priority review status during FDA review; and
+ "Addtion to Class" -an approved drug with a known therapuetic mechanism but no priority review and thought to
offer no additional therapuetic or saftey benefit

##Data Munging##

###Lanthier et al Data###
My process of cleaning the data began with Lanthier et al data set containing 645 records of drugs and biologics approved by the FDA since 1987.
I planned to use the TRADE_NAME as the key for searching the FAERS adverse event data.I removed one record that contained a duplicate name (this drug was approved twice under the same TRADE_NAME),
and shortened records with TRADE_NAME that had two words into one word to catch the maximum amount of adverse event (AE) records. This was done because
the FAERS data is user sumbitted and has low conformity to a set standard for specific drug names. As an example 'Mefloquine Hydrochloride' may only be reported in an FAERS record as "Mefloquine".

Two records ('Firmagon' and 'Nucynta') also lacked TRADE_NAME in the Lanthier et al data ,which I had to research and manually enter.
Addtionally, the Lanthier et all data was created in excel and converted into a .csv. This conversion included numerous blank rows and 
columns that I then dropped during data cleansing.I also replaced spaces with underscores for the columns names. I now have this data 
realtively clean and is represented as the 'Master_df' datafram in my code.

###FAERS data###
The FAERS consists of three separate .csv files. each for the drug, demographic, and outcome data. This data was further broken up by year and quarter.
Each of these data are linked by the ISR as the key value. I first created YEAR and QTR columns in each data set to record when the AE data had been collected.
I then aggregated each separate data set among the three categories (i.e. DRUG06Q1 + DRUG06Q2+DRUG06Q3...etc.) to form three separate and comrpehensive .csv's,
DRUGS_MASTER, OUTCOMES_MASTER,and DEMO_MASTER.csv

Scripts were then written to count the number of times each drug TRADE_NAME was found in the FAERS DRUG_MASTER.CSV to determine how many AE
were associated with a given drug. This number was further subtracted to only included the number of records that had a target drug's
trade name and was classified as a "primary suspect" or 'PS' in the data set. This because many drugs can be associated with one AE record but there
is only one primary suspect with any given report. Each drug record in the Master_df was then populated with the number of adverse events. The same was done
using each records ISR to populate from the OUTCOMES_MASTER.csv how many different types of AE outcomes (Hospitalization, Disable, etc.) were associated with each drug.

##Model Building##
The preliminary plan is to build several logistic regression models using each of the AE columns as regressors. A multiple linear regression model may
also be used if several regressors are deemed signficant.
