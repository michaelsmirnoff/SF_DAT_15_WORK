**Driver Telematics Analysis**

*I'm planning to predict driver characteristics to price driver risk in insurance scenarios.

*I have Kaggle's driver dataset (which is clean) with 200 drive trip characteristics.

*I chose this topic because it's an interesting topic with a business output, and the data set will allow for various types of analysis.
